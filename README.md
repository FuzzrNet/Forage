- Remote storage: Open storage channels to a remote storage provider over Tor
- Lightweight: Platform-optimized using Blake3-based hash, verified streaming, and encryption algorithms
- Local files can be deleted: Periodic verification of remotely stored data
- Remote files can be retrieved: Files can be proven to exist remotely and sent back
- Low write-amplification: Bytes stored are only slightly larger than bytes read

**Caution!** This is experimental, potentially dangerous technology that hasn't yet been audited!

    - [x] Query
- [x] Encode files in the `Forage Data` folder, and store them in a configured storage volume
- [ ] Decode files stored in a configured storage volume, and restore them to the `Forage Data` folder
- [ ] Verify a random slice of a file (accounting for files of varying sizes)
- [x] Display encoded file list
- [x] Paths are indexed in sqlite (path, file name, file size, creation & modification dates, file hash)
- [x] Multiple files can be stored

### 0.0.3 - Tor networking

- [ ] Generate Onion v3 address
- [ ] `peer` schema
    - [x] Schema
    - [ ] Insert
    - [ ] Query
- [ ] Open & Receive TCP socket over Tor hidden service

### 0.0.4 - Authenticated encryption

- [ ] Authentication between storage client and storage provider using Onion v3 addresses
- [ ] Blake3 keyed hashes as a MAC
- [ ] Files are encrypted using XChaCha8Blake3Siv authenticated encryption
    - **Caution!** Experimental encryption!

### 0.1.0 - Proof of Concept

Goal: A storage client that can compress, encrypt, and store data on a remote storage provider using Tor. The storage client can check periodically that the data is still present and consistent on the remote storage provider against only a local 32-byte Blake3 hash without a full local reference copy, allowing the client to delete its local data, trusting that it can retrieve it later in-full. The storage client can then retrieve the data from the storage provider and decode it on-disk.

- [ ] Storage client can open a storage channel to storage provider over Tor
    - [ ] Storage provider generates Onion v3 address to provide to storage client out-of-band
    - [ ] Storage client generates Onion v3 address of their own
    - [ ] TCP socket is established from storage client to storage provider over Tor hidden service
- [ ] Storage client can store data on storage provider
    - [ ] Storage client can supply their node with specified path to data to store remotely
    - [ ] Data is encoded using Bao, hashed with Blake3, and transmitted over TCP socket over Tor circuit
    - [ ] Blake3 hash is persisted locally
    - [ ] Optional: Delete the local data
- [ ] Storage client can periodically verify the data they sent is still present and consistent over time
    - [ ] Storage client asks for a 4KB slice of data at a random offset of their choosing from the storage storage provider
    - [ ] Storage client checks 4KB slice against the same offset against local Bao Blake3 hash
- [ ] Storage client can retrieve data from storage provider over storage channel
    - [ ] Data is written to disk at specified path
- [ ] Files are compressed using zstd dictionary compression
- [ ] Individual files can be retrieved from storage provider

### 0.1.1

- [ ] Complex volume and storage layouts

### Future

After this basic functionality exists, more exciting features are planned, including apps on the [Start9 Embassy](https://start9.com) and [Umbrel](https://getumbrel.com)!
